# Bayesian Data Analysis
For a course about bayesian data analysis in R in SS20 of the University Osnabr√ºck, I here upload my homework submissions. 

Content:
- HW01: Data wrangling (dplyr) and visualization (ggplot2)
- HW02: Non-informative vs. conjugate prior
- HW03: Linear Regression with brms I
- HW04: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Metropolis hastings algorithm)
- HW05: Linear Regression with brms II
- HW06: Linear Regression with brms III
- HW07: Statistical modeling with stan
- HW08: Finite Mixture Models & divergent transitions
- HW09: Generalized Linear Regression with brms
- HW10: Multilevel Generalized Linear Regression with brms
- HW11: Model Comparison (Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation & Bayes Factor)

**Credits for all homeworks go to the lecturer Prof. Dr. Michael Franke and tutors of this course.**
